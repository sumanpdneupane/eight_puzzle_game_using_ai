    "# (horizontally or vertically) when there's an available space, which is occupied by the blank tile.\n",
    "# 3. The objective of the 8-puzzle is to transform an initial state, defined by the arrangement of the tiles on the grid, into a specified goal state. The \n",
    "# goal state is often a predefined configuration, such as having the tiles arranged in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom, with the blank \n",

    "# The Challenge:\n",

    "# 1. The 8-puzzle has a vast number of possible states, making it essential to determine the most efficient sequence of moves.\n",
